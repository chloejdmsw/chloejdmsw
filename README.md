# Hi, I’m Chloe!
*Pronouns:she/her*

I am a **data enthusiast** who is motivated by a constant **curiosity** about people and systems.

I aspire to co-create **inclusive spaces** where individuals can show up and been **seen and heard** as their full selves.

I am passionate about designing systems that support **data driven decision making** AND center the **diverse** individuals who interact with the data.

## My Journey

- I completed a six month Data Analyst Boot Camp through The Data Incubator in June 2022 after taking some time off from full-time employment to explore the data analytics field on Coursera.

- My first introduction to using both qualititative and quantitative approaches to research and data analysis came as an undergraduate research project administrator at Rice University under the mentorship of Dr. Elaine Howard Ecklund, now Director of the Boniuk Institute for Religious Tolerance.
- I created my first database using Microsoft Access in 2008 to create Literacy First's first alumni database. I was hooked but my graduate education took me down a different path. 
- I spent about a decade using my legal and social work training as a legal advocate- working towards a client centered, trauma informed, culturally humble approach to help children, families, and advocates navigate the U.S. immigration and Texas family law systems.
- In all of my professional experiences, I always found ways to be connected to the data and continue to develop my data fluency.  For example: 
  - As the Co-Chair of the Women's Forum at my first law firm job, I collected and analyzed data about women in the firm to contribute to our annual report, highlighting the large dropoff in the ratio of female attorneys from associates to partners. 
  - As the first attorney at my non-profit to work under a new foundation grant, I designed the data collection strategy for my position, collected and analyzed the data, and drafted monthly reports to the funder. 
  - As a supervising attorney at a technical assistance provider, I oversaw data collection in the Salesforce database, which ensured compliance with government and foundation funding contracts, and drafted regular reports.  
  - As a Network for Social Work Management Policy Fellow, I collected and analyzed 12 years of government data across multiple variables impacting youth who migrate to the U.S and presented my research [Towards Equitable Access to Humanitarian Protection for Immigrant Youth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAx7zem1WFE),  on June 18, 2021.

- I am now seeking an opportunity to use the research, evaluation and data analytics skills that get me excited at an organization that aligns with my personal values--curiosity and inclusion, in a space seeking to better our communities through systems change.
